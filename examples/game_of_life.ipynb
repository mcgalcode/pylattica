    "# Conway's Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "While the concept of a cellular automaton (a model in which cells are updated based on the state of their neighbors) has been around for a while, Conway's Game of Life is the most famous example of such a system. It demonstrates quite clearly the way that very complex phenomena can emerge from simple local interactions, and has been studied extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Conway's Game of Life, a 2D square grid of cells are labelled as \"alive\" or \"dead\". Then, as the simulation progresses, the cell states flip between \"dead\" and \"alive\" depending on how many living cells surround them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automaton is a good place to start for a demonstration of pylattica because it shows a few of the fundamental features of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin though, take a quick look at the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for the Game of Life to understand what the model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, note that the rules describing the game are simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement this model using pylattica and show some of the libarary's visualization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we make a few key imports."

    "#### Site Neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "The final ingredient to the pylattica model is the concept of a neighborhood. A neighborhood is simply the set of other sites that are considered neighbors. There are many different neighborhood specifications that are possible including classic neighborhoods for 2D square grids like [Moore Neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) and [Von Neumann Neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify neighborhoods in many different ways such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All cells within a certain distance (actually Moore and Von Neumann neighborhoods both fall into this category, but with different distance cutoffs, or different distance metrics)\n",
    "- All cells given by moving in a certain direction\n",
    "- A random subset of surrounding cells\n",
    "\n",
    "pylattica provides implementations for many common neighborhoods. As specified in the Game of Life Wikipedia article, we need a Von Neumann neighborhood (includes the cells in each of the cardinal directions and a distance of one away)."
