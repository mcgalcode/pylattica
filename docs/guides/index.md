# Getting Started with Pylattica

`pylattica` is an extremely flexible library. It doesn't make many prescriptions regarding the use of the pieces that it implements. It's main goal is to provide implementations of common lattice simulation constructs which you can piece together in whatever ways aid your development use case. As a result, a generic "how to" guide is a difficult proposition.

I believe that the best way to learn how to use `pylattica` is by way of example, so I recommend looking at the examples:

- [Implementing Conway's Game of Life](./constructing_lattices.ipynb)
- `Implementing the 2D Ising Model` 

These examples show how one would assemble two well known simulations using the pieces provided by `pylattica`. However, it's likely that these examples do not illustrate everything you need for your own simulation. To see how each of the core pieces of pylattica work, take a look at the following topic-specific guides:

Finally, if all else fails, the [Reference](../reference/core/lattice.md) provides individual method-level detail for the use of this library.
