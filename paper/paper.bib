	abstract = {KMCLib is a general framework for lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. The program can handle simulations of the diffusion and reaction of millions of particles in one, two, or three dimensions, and is designed to be easily extended and customized by the user to allow for the development of complex custom KMC models for specific systems without having to modify the core functionality of the program. Analysis modules and on-the-fly elementary step diffusion rate calculations can be implemented as plugins following a well-defined API. The plugin modules are loosely coupled to the core KMCLib program via the Python scripting language. KMCLib is written as a Python module with a backend C++ library. After initial compilation of the backend library KMCLib is used as a Python module; input to the program is given as a Python script executed using a standard Python interpreter. We give a detailed description of the features and implementation of the code and demonstrate its scaling behavior and parallel performance with a simple one-dimensional A–B–C lattice KMC model and a more complex three-dimensional lattice KMC model of oxygen-vacancy diffusion in a fluorite structured metal oxide. KMCLib can keep track of individual particle movements and includes tools for mean square displacement analysis, and is therefore particularly well suited for studying diffusion processes at surfaces and in solids.
Program summary
Program title: KMCLib Catalogue identifier: AESZ\_v1\_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AESZ\_v1\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 49064 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1575172 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Python and C++. Computer: Any computer that can run a C++ compiler and a Python interpreter. Operating system: Tested on Ubuntu 12.4 LTS, CentOS release 5.9, Mac OSX 10.5.8 and Mac OSX 10.8.2, but should run on any system that can have a C++ compiler, MPI and a Python interpreter. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. From one to hundreds of processors depending on the type of input and simulation. RAM: From a few megabytes to several gigabytes depending on input parameters and the size of the system to simulate. Classification: 4.13, 16.13. External routines: KMCLib uses an external Mersenne Twister pseudo random number generator that is included in the code. A Python 2.7 interpreter and a standard C++ runtime library are needed to run the serial version of the code. For running the parallel version an MPI implementation is needed, such as e.g. MPICH from http://www.mpich.org or Open-MPI from http://www.open-mpi.org. SWIG (obtainable from http://www.swig.org/) and CMake (obtainable from http://www.cmake.org/) are needed for building the backend module, Sphinx (obtainable from http://sphinx-doc.org) for building the documentation and CPPUNIT (obtainable from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/) for building the C++ unit tests. Nature of problem: Atomic scale simulation of slowly evolving dynamics is a great challenge in many areas of computational materials science and catalysis. When the rare-events dynamics of interest is orders of magnitude slower than the typical atomic vibrational frequencies a straight-forward propagation of the equations of motions for the particles in the simulation cannot reach time scales of relevance for modeling the slow dynamics. Solution method: KMCLib provides an implementation of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that solves the slow dynamics problem by utilizing the separation of time scales between fast vibrational motion and the slowly evolving rare-events dynamics. Only the latter is treated explicitly and the system is simulated as jumping between fully equilibrated local energy minima on the slow-dynamics potential energy surface. Restrictions: KMCLib implements the lattice KMC method and is as such restricted to geometries that can be expressed on a grid in space. Unusual features: KMCLib has been designed to be easily customized, to allow for user-defined functionality and integration with other codes. The user can define her own on-the-fly rate calculator via a Python API, so that site-specific elementary process rates, or rates depending on long-range interactions or complex geometrical features can easily be included. KMCLib also allows for on-the-fly analysis with user-defined analysis modules. KMCLib can keep track of individual particle movements and includes tools for mean square displacement analysis, and is therefore particularly well suited for studying diffusion processes at surfaces and in solids. Additional comments: The full documentation of the program is distributed with the code and can also be found at http://www.github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib/manual Running time: rom a few seconds to several days depending on the type of simulation and input parameters.},

	abstract = {Diffusion and clustering of lattice vacancies in silicon as a function of temperature, concentration, and interaction range are investigated by kinetic lattice Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that higher temperatures lead to larger clusters with shorter lifetimes on average, which grow by attracting free vacancies, while clusters at lower temperatures grow by the aggregation of smaller clusters. Long interaction ranges produce enhanced diffusivity and fewer clusters. Greater vacancy concentrations lead to more clusters, with fewer free vacancies, but the size of the clusters is largely independent of concentration. Vacancy diffusivity is shown to obey power law behavior over time, and the exponent of this law is shown to increase with concentration, at fixed temperature, and decrease with temperature, at a fixed concentration.},

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

We will provide worked out examples using the kmos code, where we highlight the central approximations made in implementing a KMC model as well as possible pitfalls. This includes the mapping of the problem onto a lattice and the derivation of rate constant expressions for various elementary processes. Example KMC models will be presented within the application areas surface diffusion, crystal growth and heterogeneous catalysis, covering both transient and steady-state kinetics as well as the preparation of various initial states of the system. We highlight the sensitivity of KMC models to the elementary processes included, as well as to possible errors in the rate constants. For catalysis models in particular, a recurrent challenge is the occurrence of processes at very different timescales, e.g., fast diffusion processes and slow chemical reactions. We demonstrate how to overcome this timescale disparity problem using recently developed acceleration algorithms. Finally, we will discuss how to account for lateral interactions between the species adsorbed to the lattice, which can play an important role in all application areas covered here.},

	abstract = {The paper is about cellular automaton models in materials science. It gives an introduction to the fundamentals of cellular automata and reviews applications, particularly for those that predict recrystallization phenomena. Cellular automata for recrystallization are typically discrete in time, physical space, and orientation space and often use quantities such as dislocation density and crystal orientation as state variables. Cellular automata can be defined on a regular or nonregular two- or three-dimensional lattice considering the first, second, and third neighbor shell for the calculation of the local driving forces. The kinetic transformation rules are usually formulated to map a linearized symmetric rate equation for sharp grain boundary segment motion. While deterministic cellular automata directly perform cell switches by sweeping the corresponding set of neighbor cells in accord with the underlying rate equation, probabilistic cellular automata calculate the switching probability of each lattice point and make the actual decision about a switching event by evaluating the local switching probability using a Monte Carlo step. Switches are in a cellular automaton algorithm generally performed as a function of the previous state of a lattice point and the state of the neighboring lattice points. The transformation rules can be scaled in terms of time and space using, for instance, the ratio of the local and the maximum possible grain boundary mobility, the local crystallographic texture, the ratio of the local and the maximum-occurring driving forces, or appropriate scaling measures derived from a real initial specimen. The cell state update in a cellular automaton is made in synchrony for all cells. The review deals, in particular, with the prediction of the kinetics, microstructure, and texture of recrystallization. Couplings between cellular automata and crystal plasticity finite element models are also discussed.},
